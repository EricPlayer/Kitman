<br><br>

    <span class="medTreb">
        <strong>LAST UPDATED: JANUARY 1, 2017</strong><br>
       These Terms and Conditions of Use create a legal contract between you and us. Please read them. RJ Roberts Design LLC (“Swagafied,” “we,” or “us”) operates a live marketplace that allows users to research, buy and sell certain consumer goods. These Terms and Conditions of Use, the Swagafied Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”), our Marketplace FAQs (the “FAQS”), and all policies and requirements posted on our sites, all of which are incorporated into these Terms and Conditions of Use by reference and as amended from time to time (collectively, “Terms”) describe the terms and conditions on which we provides our websites, services, data, software, applications (including mobile applications) and tools (collectively "Services") to you, whether as a guest or a registered user.
<br><br>
By using our Services, or by clicking to accept or agree to these Terms and the Swagafied Privacy when this option is made available to you upon registration, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms. If you do not want to agree to these, you must not access or use our websites or download use our Services.
<br><br>
If you are under 18 years old (or under the legal age of majority for your jurisdiction), then you must have permission from your parent or guardian before using the Services. Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 years old is strictly prohibited and in violation of these Terms. You agree to comply with the Terms when accessing or using our Services. If you do not agree to the Terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.
<BR /><BR />
<strong>These Terms and Conditions contain provisions that govern how claims between you and us are resolved. This includes an obligation to arbitrate certain claims through binding and final arbitration, unless you opt out of the arbitration when you sign up with us. Unless you opt out, you will only be permitted to bring claims against us and seek relief on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding and you will only be permitted to seek relief on an individual basis. </strong><br>
        <br />
    1.	<strong>Changes to Terms and Policies.</strong> Swagafied may in our discretion change these Terms (including the Privacy Policy and the FAQs or any policy) without notice to you. Changes take effect when we post them on our sites. <strong>YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE AFTER WE CHANGE THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY CHANGES, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT. </strong><br /><br />
2.	<strong>Swagafied Live Marketplace.</strong> Swagafied provides a live marketplace for buyers and sellers of certain consumer products. A description of the live marketplace process and the rules applicable to buyers and sellers is on our FAQ page, as updated from time to time. To view or browse the live marketplace, you must create an account using an email address and password or other account creation tools offered on the Services, such as a social media account. To offer items for sale (“Ask”) or offer to purchase items (“Bid”), you must create an account and have a valid credit card or other approved payment method on file with us. You agree that we may charge your credit card or other payment method for amounts you owe us as described in these terms, as well as any costs or losses arising from your violation of the Terms. When you register to create an account with us, you agree to provide accurate information about yourself and must not register under a false name or age or use an unauthorized payment method. If you use any Service, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. Please review our other policies posted on this site which are part of the Terms and govern your use of the Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and the Terms at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition. 
<br /><br />
3.	F<strong>ees, Promotional/Discount Codes and Taxes.</strong> Fees for the Services are described in our FAQ, as updated from time to time. Swagafied may sometimes furnish an alphanumeric code that can be used for promotions or discounts for purchases on our sites. These promotional or discount codes may be sent via email to our registered users, presented on our web sites or circulated at events and through other means and, unless otherwise provided are subject to the promotional or discount terms available here Discount Policy. As a seller you agree to pay any and all local, state, federal, or international taxes (including VAT and sales tax) that may be due with respect to your sales transaction, and as a buyer you agree to pay any and all local, state, federal, or international taxes (including sales taxes) that may be due with respect to your purchase transaction. You agree that Swagafied, as the facilitator of the transaction, is not responsible for payment of any taxes on your behalf. You agree to provide Swagafied with your Social Security Number or tax ID if necessary for Swagafied to provide information to the Internal Revenue Service related to payments you receive from us and further authorize Swagafied to release that information to the IRS or other competent governmental body.
<br /><br />
4.	<strong>Swagafied’s Role. </strong>Although the Services include buy and sell functionality: (1) Swagafied facilitates the purchase transaction, but the actual purchase contract is directly between the buyer and seller; (2) although Swagafied might provide historical pricing data, we do not set prices for the items; and (3) Swagafied is not an auctioneer. Because sellers set prices, they may be higher than retail value. Any item valuations displayed through the Services are estimates only. Swagafied does not guarantee that any item will sell. We reserve the right to investigate complaints and violations of these Terms and may take any actions we deem appropriate, including suspending your account and charging your credit card for costs we incur as a result of the violation. Although the Services are anonymous and we generally do not share your information with other buyers and sellers, we may share your information with law enforcement and other third parties as part of an investigation related to any alleged violation of law or these Terms, and we may respond to all inquiries initiated by law enforcement or other governmental agencies.
<br /><br />
5.	<strong>Authentication; Shipping and Handling.</strong> As part of the purchase transaction, the seller will ship the item directly to the buyer. Swagafied will not perform or conduct any commercially reasonable efforts to confirm it is authenticity. If a buyer cannot reasonably confirm the authenticity of the item or determines it is not authentic, the buyer shall notify the seller that the item is not authentic and should request the seller to issue a refund to the buyer. Swagafied policy requires sellers to ship items within two (2) business days of the purchase. However, because Swagafied cannot control the amount of time it takes for the item to be shipped, we cannot guarantee a specific delivery timeframe for any items. If a buyer does not receive an item, the buyer shall promptly report the issue to the seller within 2 days of the latest estimated delivery date.
<br /><br />
6.	<strong>Counterfeits, Fraud, and Market Manipulation.</strong> Swagafied takes counterfeiting, fraud and market manipulation very seriously. If a seller provides a counterfeit item or attempts to defraud any buyer or Swagafied, Swagafied reserves the right to do any or all of the following, in its sole discretion: (i) remove any or all of seller’s listings from the Services; (ii) cancel any or all of seller’s orders pending through the Services; (iii) withhold any payments due to seller; (iv) place limits on seller’s buying and selling privileges; (v) charge seller’s credit card for costs, expenses and fees incurred by Swagafied as a result of seller’s action or inaction, including charging seller for the cost of replacement items, the value of coupons and gift certificates provided to the buyer, reprinting fees incurred by Swagafied, rerouting charges imposed by carriers, and refunds to the buyer; (vi) ship the item back to the seller at the seller’s cost; (vii) provide the counterfeit items to law enforcement or destroy the counterfeit items, (viii) temporarily or permanently suspend seller’s account, and (ix) charge Seller’s credit card an additional amount equal to 15% of the transaction amount as a service fee. Seller hereby agrees that each of the foregoing remedies are reasonable and justified upon Swagafied’s discovery of counterfeit items or fraudulent actions, even if those items or actions were not known by the Seller at the time to be counterfeit or fraudulent (e.g., negligent fraud). Seller understands and agrees that if we provide the counterfeit item to law enforcement, seller’s communications and any property claim with respect to that item must be solely with that law enforcement agency and not with us. We may also use fraud protection measures, including algorithms and automated systems to monitor for fraud, which might result in cancellation of listings or sales or account suspension. If this occurs in error please contact us at info@rjrobertsdesign.com. We may also require additional identification information from you if you engage in certain high-value transactions or high overall payment volumes through Swagafied.
<br /><br />
7.<strong> Seller Obligations.</strong> By listing an item for sale (each posting, a “New Ask”), you are making a binding offer to sell that specific item to a buyer who purchases the item for the Ask price you have specified and to ship the item in accordance with our terms of use as updated from time to time. When a buyer accepts your offer by purchasing your item through our Services, you are contractually and legally bound to deliver that exact item for the specified price. SELLERS MUST SHIP items via USPS, FedEx, UPS or DHL within two (2) business days of the purchase 
<br /><br />
As a seller, you are required to ensure that the item you are listing exactly matches the image on the original product page and is in the condition specified, in the correct size as indicated, with the original box or receipt if identified as present. 
<br /><br />
<strong>8.	Limitations and Restrictions.</strong> Swagafied does not provide any guarantee that your items will sell and will not provide any compensation for items that do not sell through our Services. Swagafied also does not guarantee how long it will take for a listing to appear in the Services after it is posted and is not responsible for unsold items resulting from any listing delays. Swagafied conducts periodic scheduled maintenance as well as unscheduled emergency maintenance from time to time. During maintenance periods the Services (or portions thereof) may be temporarily unavailable. <br /><br />You must not do any of the following:
<br /><br />
- use our Services to solicit sales outside of Swagafied or to contact any user of the Services;
<br /><br />
- engage in abusive treatment of other users of the Services or any Swagafied employee;
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
- bypass our robot exclusion headers, robots.txt rules or any other measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to our Services; or
<br /><br />
- do anything else that we determine, in our sole discretion, misuses the Services or otherwise negatively impacts our marketplace.
